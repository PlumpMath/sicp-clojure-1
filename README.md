============

Material from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, in Clojure.

**Disclaimer**:
This is not an attempt to produce perfect code, it has been written while learning Clojure, in an attempt of both reading a great Computer Science book and doing its exercises using a modern Lisp-like language.
